## Overview

**Important Note:** Do not assume the current UI implementation (both design and business logic) represents the desired final state. This document defines the target architecture and functionality.

This document establishes the technical guidelines, architectural requirements, and feature roadmap for our frontend engineering partners. These specifications serve as the definitive scope and quality standards for all frontend development work on the Seamless Protocol platform.

## 1. Technical Foundation & Architecture Requirements

### 1.1 Core Technology Stack

- **Framework:** React (latest stable version)
- **Blockchain Integration:** Wagmi/Viem for onchain connectivity
- **Deployment:** IPFS-compatible static bundle compilation
- **Build System:** Optimized production builds with code splitting
- **Design system:** ShadCDN, Storybook or similar. Goal is to have well structured and reusable design components

### 1.2 Testing & Quality Assurance

- **Unit Testing:** Comprehensive coverage for all mathematical calculations and business logic
- **Integration Testing:** Complete blockchain interaction (i.e.: chain write operations) testing using Anvil fork or similar
- **CI/CD:** Automated test execution in GitHub Actions pipeline
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling and form validation throughout the application

### 1.3 Performance & State Management

- **Caching:** Efficient cache management with proper invalidation on user actions
- **State Management:** Robust application state handling
- **Bundle Optimization:** Code splitting and performance optimization for production deployment

### 1.4 Wallet & Blockchain Support

- **Multi-Wallet Support:** Smart wallets, WalletConnect, and other modern wallet solutions
- **ENS Integration:** Display and resolution of Ethereum Name Service addresses
- **Multi-Chain Architecture:**
    - Current deployment: Base network
    - Planned expansion: Ethereum mainnet and additional chains
    - Scalable configuration management for contract addresses across chains

### 1.5 Analytics & Monitoring

- **Event Analytics:** Basic user interaction and behavior tracking (e.g.: Google analytics)
- **Error Reporting:** Comprehensive error analytics (currently using Sentry, open to alternatives)
- **Performance Monitoring:** Application performance and user experience metrics (especially error tracking)

### 1.6 Code Quality Standards

- **Documentation:** High-quality inline documentation and code comments
- **Security:** Industry best practices for onchain DeFi application security
- **Maintainability:** Clean, readable, and scalable code architecture
- **Dependencies:** Minimize external dependencies where possible (e.g., prefer direct ERC4626 interaction over Morpho SDK if the SDK doesn't provide substantial added value)

---

## 2. Data Architecture & Sources

### 2.1 Data Source Hierarchy

**Priority Order:** Maximize on-chain data usage, minimize centralized dependencies

### 2.2 Primary Data Sources

- **On-Chain RPC Data:** Direct blockchain queries for real-time data (preferred method)
- **Morpho API:** Historical Morpho protocol data and analytics
- **Fuul Integration:** Reward program data via SDK, API, and Subgraph
- **Seamless Subgraph:** Historical leverage token and protocol data
- **Price Feeds:** Token pricing and metadata (currently CoinGecko, open to alternatives like Coinbase CDP or Alchemy API or even onchain oracles)

### 2.3 Data Management Principles

- Use on-chain RPC data for all real-time and current state information
- Resort to APIs only for historical data or complex aggregations not feasible on-chain
- Implement efficient data caching and invalidation strategies
- Ensure data consistency across different sources

- Display comprehensive token metrics and performance data
- Configurable metadata for each token. e.g.: custom FAQ, warnings, etc.

### 2.3 Mint/Redeem Functionality

- Integration with KyberSwap (likely) Widget for token operations
- Custom styling to match Seamless brand guidelines
- Complete transaction flow with proper error handling

### Phase 3: User Dashboard & Holdings
