# Daily Handoff — 2025-09-04

This handoff summarizes today’s changes around leverage token pricing and table display, along with next-step guidance for the incoming engineer.

## Summary

- Added a minimal, batched CoinGecko USD pricing path and integrated it into the leverage tokens table data flow.
- Updated the TVL column to show native debt asset units first (e.g., `173 WETH`) with an optional approximate USD line (`≈ $X`) when prices are available.
- Kept the architecture simple and consistent: on-chain state for TVL, subgraph for historical charts, CoinGecko for spot USD conversions.

## What Changed

- New fetcher: `src/lib/prices/coingecko.ts`
  - Uses CoinGecko `simple/token_price/{platform}` endpoint.
  - Platform map included: `1 → ethereum`, `8453 → base`; extendable.
- Centralized endpoint via `getApiEndpoint('coingecko')`; environment override supported.

- New hook: `src/lib/prices/useUsdPrices.ts`
  - `useUsdPrices({ chainId, addresses })` returns `{ [addressLower]: usd }`.
  - React Query with `staleTime = 15s`, `refetchInterval = 15s`; batched by chain.

- Table data wiring: `src/features/leverage-tokens/hooks/useLeverageTokensTableData.ts`
  - Collects unique `debtAsset.address` values from configs and fetches USD prices via `useUsdPrices`.
  - Computes `tvl` (equity in debt units) and `tvlUsd = tvl * usdPrice[debtAsset]` when available.

- Table UI: `src/features/leverage-tokens/components/LeverageTokenTable.tsx`
  - TVL column now displays:
    - Line 1: native units (e.g., `173 WETH`).
    - Line 2: `≈ $X` only when `tvlUsd` is present.
  - Type update: added `tvlUsd?: number` to row model.

- Architecture doc updated: `docs/leverage-tokens-data-plan.md`
  - Reflects CoinGecko pricing layer, cadence, and hooks.

## Why

- Avoid overbuilding a pricing module while enabling accurate USD approximations.
- Keep native units as the source of truth; USD as a convenience view.
- Ensure minimal API calls through batching and reasonable refresh intervals.

## Configuration

- CoinGecko endpoint is configurable via environment; see `.env.local` in your workspace.

## Testing & Verification

- Build and load `/tokens` page:
  - Rows show native TVL (e.g., `WETH`) immediately from on-chain.
  - USD approximation appears within 15s for supported `debtAsset.address`.
  - Disable network or remove the env override to verify fallbacks (USD line hidden when unavailable).

## Follow-Ups (Suggested)

- Current scope is Base (8453) and potentially Ethereum mainnet (1); platform mapping for both is already included.
- Reuse `useUsdPrices` for any other components needing USD approximations (e.g., stat cards, detail pages).
- Optional: add support for multiple quote currencies by passing `vs_currencies=usd,eur` and selecting from the map.
- Optional: add a subgraph-backed price provider behind the same interface for redundancy.
- Consider lowering USD price cadence to 10s if needed, but beware rate limits.
