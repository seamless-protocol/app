# Phase II Leverage Tokens - Handoff Document

## üéØ Current Status: Router-Based Architecture Foundation Complete

This branch contains the foundational infrastructure for Router-based leverage token minting. **The mint flow is NOT completely implemented** - this is scaffolding and architecture work.

---

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Correct Architecture Discovery & Implementation**
- **Fixed fundamental issue**: Frontend was trying to mint tokens directly (`token.mint()`)
- **Implemented correct flow**: User ‚Üí Router ‚Üí Manager ‚Üí LeverageToken
- Router-based approach matches the actual deployed contract architecture

### 2. **Contract Integration**
- `leverageRouter.ts` - Complete Router ABI with mint/redeem functions
- `leverageManager.ts` - Manager ABI with previewMint for share calculations  
- Updated contract addresses to include Router
- All ABIs match deployed Base mainnet contracts

### 3. **Core Hook Infrastructure**
- `useMintViaRouter` hook - Router-based minting with proper flow
- Handles: preview ‚Üí approve ‚Üí simulate ‚Üí write ‚Üí wait
- Includes slippage protection and auto-approval
- **BUT**: SwapContext is currently placeholder/noop implementation

### 4. **Testing Infrastructure**
- Tenderly Virtual TestNet integration working
- Real contract testing against deployed Base contracts
- Integration tests validate the Router approach
- Tests confirm noop SwapContext correctly fails (as expected)

### 5. **Type System & Utilities**
- `SwapContext` types matching Router ABI exactly
- Helper functions for noop/single-hop contexts
- Proper error handling and classification

---

## ‚ùå What's NOT Complete (Critical Gaps)

### 1. **DEX Integration - MISSING**
The biggest gap is SwapContext configuration:
- Router expects valid DEX routing for leverage operations
- Current implementation uses noop SwapContext (intentionally fails)
- Need actual Aerodrome/Uniswap router addresses and path encoding
- **Without this, minting will always fail**

### 2. **Frontend UI - MISSING**
- No actual mint/redeem components built
- No user-facing forms or interfaces
- Hook exists but nothing calls it

### 3. **Real User Flow Testing**
- Tests use simulated funding via Tenderly admin
- No end-to-end user wallet testing
- Need testing with real wallet connections and approvals

### 4. **Production Configuration**
- SwapContext configuration for Base DEXes missing
- Fee tier and routing optimization not implemented
- Max slippage and swap cost calculations need refinement

## üåÖ Getting Started Tomorrow Morning

### Before Tech Lead Arrives (45 min)
1. **Get oriented** (15 min)
   - `git checkout feature/tenderly-integration && git pull`
   - Read `HANDOFF.md`, `tests/integration/FINDINGS.md`, and `useMintViaRouter.ts`
   - Run `bun run build` and `bun check:fix` to verify current state

2. **Research V1 patterns** (25 min) 
   - Study existing V1 interface DEX integration
   - Identify which DEXes V1 uses on Base (Aerodrome? Uniswap?)
   - Understand V1's swap routing configuration patterns
   - Note any existing swap utilities or helpers

3. **Test current integration** (5 min)
   - Run integration tests to confirm Tenderly setup works
   - Verify noop SwapContext fails as expected

### First Tech Lead Discussion
- V1 DEX patterns discovered
- Proposed configurable SwapContext approach
- Questions about routing complexity vs simplicity

---

## üö® Immediate Next Steps for Handoff Engineer

### Priority 1: Internal DEX Routing (CRITICAL - SwapContext)
The Router contract needs SwapContext for **internal protocol swaps during leverage creation**.

**Approach:**
1. **Research V1 interface first** - Understand how DEX routing is implemented in existing app
2. **Prioritize V1 DEXes** - Use the same DEXes/patterns that V1 already supports
3. **Make it configurable** - Don't hardcode specific DEX, allow runtime configuration
4. **Start simple** - Get one working path, then expand

```typescript
// Implementation should be configurable like V1
const swapContext = createSwapContext({
  fromToken: USDC_ADDRESS,
  toToken: WETH_ADDRESS, 
  exchange: getPreferredExchange(), // Based on V1 patterns
  slippageTolerance: 50 // bps
})
```

**Next Engineer Tasks:**
1. Study V1 interface DEX integration patterns
2. Identify which DEXes V1 uses on Base
3. Implement configurable SwapContext system
4. Test successful mint with Tenderly integration

### Priority 2: Hook Testing Strategy  
After DEX routing works in Tenderly integration:
1. **Verify useMintViaRouter hook behavior** - Test the hook itself in isolation
2. **Integration test validation** - Ensure full mint flow works end-to-end
3. **Error scenario coverage** - Test slippage, failed swaps, insufficient funds

### Priority 3: Frontend Components (ShadCN)
Once mint hook is tested and working:
```typescript
// Build simple UI components with ShadCN
- MintForm component (uses useMintViaRouter hook)
- RedeemForm component (future)
- Token selection interface  
- Slippage settings for internal swaps
- Transaction status/confirmation
```

### Priority 4: Complete Integration Testing
- Test with real DEX routing (once implemented)
- End-to-end user flow testing 
- Error scenario coverage
- Gas optimization testing

**Note**: Kyber swap widget integration not relevant for this feature - focus on leverage token minting flow

## üìã Architecture Decisions Made

### Router-Based Flow (Correct)
```
User funds ‚Üí Approve Router ‚Üí Router.mint() ‚Üí Manager.mint() ‚Üí LeverageToken
```

### Slippage Protection
- Uses Manager.previewMint() to calculate expected shares
- Applies user-specified slippage tolerance (default 50 bps)
- Protects against MEV and price impact

### Test Strategy
- Unit tests: Business logic and error handling
- Integration tests: Real contract interaction on Tenderly VNet  
- E2E tests: Full user flows (planned, not implemented)

---

## üîç Key Discoveries from Testing

### 1. **Architecture Issue Found & Fixed**
- Original frontend approach was fundamentally wrong
- Leverage tokens are owned by Manager, not directly mintable
- Router pattern is the correct approach per contract design

### 2. **Contract Verification**  
- All contract addresses and ABIs validated against Base mainnet
- previewMint function works correctly for share calculations
- Router properly validates SwapContext (rejects noop as expected)

### 3. **Integration Infrastructure Works**
- Tenderly VNet connection successful  
- Real contract interaction verified
- Test isolation with snapshots working

## üß† Context for Next Engineer

This work establishes the **correct architectural foundation** for leverage token minting. The previous approach was wrong at a fundamental level. What we have now:

1. **Correct contract integration** - Router-based approach matches deployment
2. **Solid testing infrastructure** - Can validate changes against real contracts  
3. **Type-safe implementation** - All ABIs and types properly defined
4. **Clear remaining work** - DEX integration is the main blocker

The foundation is solid, but significant work remains to make it user-facing functional.
